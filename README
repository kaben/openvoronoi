The OpenVoronoi project aims to produce an algorithm for calculating
the 2D voronoi-diagram for point, line-segment, and circular-arc sites.
Currently point-sites work well and line-segment sites are being worked
on. The incremental topology-oriented algorithm is used (see References).
OpenVoronoi is written by Anders Wallin (anders.e.e.wallin "at" gmail.com)
and released under GPLv3 (see COPYING).

Voronoi diagrams are used for many purposes in computational geometry,
but the motivation for OpenVoronoi has mainly been 2D offset-generation
(see offset.hpp) for cnc mill toolpath calcuations. An experimental 
approximate medial-axis filter (medial_axis.hpp) has been added.

The OpenVoronoi project is at 
https://github.com/aewallin/openvoronoi

The mailing-list for OpenVoronoi is at
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/opencamlib

There is a gallery of voronoi diagrams produced with OpenVoronoi at

Dependencies
python
git (required only for the version-string)
cmake
Boost graph library
Boost python (if python bindings are built)
libQD (a quad-precision arithmetic library). Available as package 
"liqd-dev" on ubuntu. See "http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/

most python-examples use VTK and the VTK python bindings to visualize
the input geometry and the voronoi diagram. On ubuntu these are available 
in the packages
- libvtk (Ubuntu 11.10 has libvtk5.6)
- python-vtk

many examples use truetype-tracer (python module "ttt") for generating input data.
https://github.com/aewallin/truetype-tracer

some examples and tests use the 2-opt random polygon generator from CGAL.
There is a boost-python module "rpg" which is used by these scripts.

Build/Install instructions

From PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:anders-e-e-wallin/cam
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openvoronoi

From source
$ git clone git://github.com/aewallin/openvoronoi.git
$ cd openvoronoi
$ mkdir bld
$ cd bld
$ cmake ../src
$ make
$ sudo make install

Tests
There are Python test-scripts and C++ test-subdirectories in src/test/ that
can be run with CTest.  In the build-directory either "make test" or "ctest"
will run all tests.  You can run only tests that have e.g. "ttt" in the
test-name with
  $ ctest -R ttt
or
  $ make test ARGS="-R ttt"
See the file "src/test/README.txt" for more details.

Organization
doc/        has documentation in lyx format, with figures in asymptote format. 
            Build a PDF with the CMakeLists.txt in this directory.
cpp_examples/ has c++ examples (more needed)
python_examples/ has Python examples. Many use VTK and VTK's python bindingd for visualization.
src/        has the source for the main algorithm
src/solvers has vd-vertex solver code
src/py      has python wrapping code
src/common  has common classes not specific to voronoi diagrams
src/utility input and output from OpenVoronoi to/from various formats

VRONI/Martin Held. This code is commercial and not available, as far as
we know. 
http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/vroni/vroni.html
Patel (see References) seems to have independently implemented the
same algorithm, we don't know where this code is or under what license it is.
